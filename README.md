# Online-Car-Rental-System

Project Name:
Online Car Rental System

Goal:
Create an interactive vehicle rental system based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, whereby users can rent a car on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. The system must record rental time, handle stock, and automatically generate bills when the cars are returned.

Issue Statement:
•	A car rental business needs an online platform where customers can:
•	See available vehicles
•	Select a rental period (hourly, daily, weekly)
•	Rent a single or multiple cars subject to availability
•	Get an auto-generated bill at return
•	The platform must provide input validation, tracking of rental time, inventory update, and correct billing depending on rental duration and type.
•	Tools and Technologies Used:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
•	Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), DateTime module

System Modules:
1. car_rental_module.py
Has two primary classes:
1.	CarRental
2.	Manages inventory

Processes rentals in hourly, daily, or weekly term
Calculates rental time and bill
Customer
Processes customer requests and return actions
Maintains rental time, number of cars, and rental basis

2. main_car_rental.ipynb
Offers a menu-based console user interface
Enables users to:
•	Print available cars
•	Request cars for hire
•	Return cars and print bills
•	Exit the application
•	Validates user input and responds to wrong choices politely

Key Features Implemented:
Customers have the option of renting for an hour (₹10/hr), a day (₹50/day), or a week (₹200/week).
Rentals are permitted only when requested car numbers are within available stock.
Python's datetime module is used to record rental time and find duration.
Bill is automatically generated by duration and rental mode.
Car stock is updated in real time on rent and return.

Advantages:
Real-time inventory and billing management
Simple text interface friendly to user
Clean modular design with OOP
Simple extensibility to GUI or web application in future
